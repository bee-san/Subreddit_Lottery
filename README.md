# Problem

When running giveaways, users often do not believe the results to be true.

In this competition 5 people won 2 prizes, and 1 person won 2 prizes with only 2 tickets. This looks rigged, but I can promise you it is fair.

# Solution

We build an automated, open source lottery on the Blockchain that anyone can verify the results of. No matter how "rigged" these results look, anyone can verify that they are real.
